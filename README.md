# Forge — a fund formation engine

**Forge is a local-first AI fund-formation engine — drafting, negotiation,
side letters, and a decade of obligations — where every answer is quoted
verbatim from your own documents and every client name is masked on-device
before anything leaves the machine, so a lawyer can actually trust it.**

> "The idea is that we're going to take the collective intelligence of our
> institution and be able to deploy that throughout our firm."

It's a working homage to the Kirkland & Ellis / Palantir "Fund Formation
Engine" — the whole private-equity fundraising lifecycle — built around the
two things their platform conspicuously doesn't show publicly:

1. **Verified citations, not trust.** Every AI assertion is quoted verbatim
   and machine-checked against the source document on file. A green ✓ means
   the words are really there; a red ✗ means they aren't, and the engine
   never hides which. (The same FT article we started from is framed by two
   firms sanctioned for AI hallucinations.)
2. **Provable confidentiality, not a promise.** Names are masked on the
   lawyer's own machine before any frontier call; a panel shows the exact
   sanitized payload; matters live in separate encrypted files.

### Why local-first

Fund formation runs on the most sensitive data a firm holds — LP identities,
commitment sizes, bespoke side-letter economics — under ethical-wall and
client-confidence duties. "Send it to a cloud AI" is where compliance review
ends. So the sensitive layer (the raw names, the documents, retrieval, the
database) stays on the machine, and **only name-masked, sanitized text ever
crosses the boundary** to the frontier model. Local-*first*, not local-only:
you get frontier-grade reasoning without surrendering the confidential data
to get it. That hybrid is the whole bet.

Fictional client: **Vulcan Industrial Partners** (named for the Roman god of
the forge), raising Fund III — $3B, 14 investors. Not legal advice; not a
law firm; not affiliated with anyone.

## What it does

**Bring your own documents.** The *Intake* tab is the point of it: create an
engagement, upload your own LPA or side letter (PDF / Word / Markdown / text),
and the engine parses it on-device, extracts every ongoing obligation, and
checks each one verbatim against the source before it enters your register —
then you can ask the register in plain English. Side letters are linked to
their investor (auto-detected from the letter, or named at upload; unknown
LPs are created on the spot), so the MFN compendium, deadlines, and
attribution all run on your documents, not just the demo's. Investors and
their comments enter through the front door too: add an LP over the API or
UI, paste their counsel's actual mark-up, and the negotiation stage runs on
what they really sent. The fictional Vulcan corpus below is just a worked
example; every pipeline works the same on what you bring.

The full demo arc, each stage thin but real:

1. **Drafting** — paste a commercial term sheet; four specialized roles
   (insight-capturer → extractor → drafter → feedback-integrator) draft LPA
   sections from the model-document library, prior funds, and what investors
   said last time. Progress streams live.
2. **Change assessment** — "expand the geographic mandate to emerging
   markets" → current reading, market examples from the corpus, a menu of
   drafting alternatives.
3. **Comment triage** — paste LP counsel's mark-up or email and it's
   atomized into individual deal-point comments; the queue is organized by
   deal point with AI suggested resolutions citing model language and the
   investor's own precedent. Accepting or editing is a pure database write —
   the lawyer's judgment never leaves the loop.
4. **Side letters** — agreed terms in, **three** complete drafts out,
   following the reuse hierarchy: exact model language → adapted precedent →
   fresh drafting. Every clause is color-coded by where its words came from.
   Mark the draft you signed as **executed** and the loop closes: it's filed
   as a closed document against its investor, its clauses become house
   precedent, its duties are extracted onto the register, and the next MFN
   compendium run sees it.
5. **Obligations register** — the ontology payoff. "We have a time-sensitive
   new deal in sub-Saharan Africa — what obligations do we have?" → answer,
   urgency-ordered checklist, affected investors, every step citing the
   clause that created the duty, verified verbatim.
6. **MFN compendium** — every side-letter provision in the fund, the
   eligibility threshold and election window parsed from the fund's own MFN
   clause, who can elect what (grantee excluded), the election deadline, and
   an electable vs recipient-specific classification with cited reasoning.
7. **Word-native deliverables** — the MFN compendium and side-letter draft
   sets export as clean .docx with a numbered Sources annex: every in-text
   [n] marker resolves to the verbatim quoted clause, its ontology id, and
   its verification mark, so the trust story survives the export.
8. **Matter workspaces — ethical walls.** Each matter is a separate database
   file; only the open one is readable, so cross-matter contamination is
   impossible by construction. Closed matters can be locked — encrypted at
   rest (AES-256-GCM, scrypt-derived key) under a passphrase.
9. **Scanned PDFs work.** When a PDF has no text layer (a real scanner's
   output), pages are rendered and OCR'd entirely on-device. The only
   network access is a one-time ~15 MB download of Tesseract's public
   English model; document content never leaves the machine.
10. **The compounding loop.** Comment resolutions a lawyer accepted or
    edited, clauses from executed side letters, and sections revised under
    feedback are promoted to weighted house precedent — and feed the next
    suggestion, citably. Every engagement makes the next one smarter, and
    the Overview shows exactly what's been learned.
11. **Deadlines — obligations that act.** Concrete due dates computed for
   every recurring duty (quarterly/annual anchors, business-day math read
   from the clause itself), an event planner ("closing July 15 → notice to
   Norrland due June 24"), drafted reminder emails with verified citations,
   and one-click iCalendar export. The date math is deterministic and local
   — no model call; only the email drafting touches the frontier.

## The two models

- **Frontier**: `claude-fable-5` (Anthropic) does the drafting and reasoning —
  structured output only, every response schema-validated.
- **Local** (Ollama, on your machine) plays two roles:
  - **Privacy gateway** — before any text leaves the machine, fund and
    investor names (and derived short forms) are replaced with reversible
    placeholders using the ontology as the source of truth, then a local
    NER pass catches names the ontology has never seen. The frontier model
    sees `[INVESTOR_3]`; your client list stays home. Next to a masked name
    only the investor's *type* is sent ("pension", "family office") —
    jurisdiction is held back by default, because type + jurisdiction
    together can re-identify an LP in a small fund
    (`FORGE_SEND_JURISDICTION=1` to opt in).
  - **Local search** — embeddings + SQLite FTS5 hybrid retrieval. Retrieval
    always runs locally on raw data.

The **"What left your machine"** panel shows the exact sanitized payload of
every frontier call. When Ollama is down, everything degrades gracefully:
regex-only anonymization, keyword-only search, a visible badge.

**Be precise about the promise.** What's masked is *names* — fund, investor,
and (via NER) other parties. The legal text itself, including amounts and
dates, is sent in clear: that is what makes verbatim citation verification
possible. Third-party names inside uploaded documents are protected by the
local NER pass only — when Ollama is down, names the ontology doesn't know
travel unmasked, and the UI badge says so.

**Citations are enforced, not requested.** Every AI assertion must quote its
source; quotes are verified verbatim (whitespace-normalized) against the
ontology after de-anonymization. Unverified citations are flagged in the UI.

## Run it

Three steps from clone to a working firm:

```bash
npm install && npm run setup  # installs the UI, builds it, seeds the demo corpus
cp .env.example .env          # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run dev                   # → http://localhost:3000
```

Then try the demo moment: open **Obligations** and ask the prefilled
question — *"We have a time-sensitive new deal in sub-Saharan Africa. What
obligations do we have?"* Thirty seconds later you have an urgency-ordered
checklist where every step quotes the clause that created the duty, each
quote machine-verified against the document. Then go to **Documents**,
upload one of your own contracts, and watch the same thing happen to it.

Optional but recommended — the local model for the privacy gateway and
semantic search (everything degrades gracefully without it):

```bash
ollama pull gemma2:2b && ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Dev UI with hot reload: `cd web && npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173.

## Verify

```bash
npm test          # unit tests — no network
npm run smoke     # end-to-end through all five stages + degraded pass
                  # (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; SMOKE_SKIP_DRAFTING=1 to skip the slow stage)
npm run eval      # the honesty check: extraction recall/precision against
                  # hand-labeled documents (including unseen ones) + Q&A
                  # retrieval recall. Citation verification proves what the
                  # engine SAYS; the eval measures what it MISSES. Every
                  # metric on the scoreboard is gated — recall, precision,
                  # field accuracy, verified-verbatim share, Q&A recall —
                  # and the chance baseline is printed next to the result.
```
